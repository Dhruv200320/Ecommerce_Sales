🛒 Dhruv Ecommerce Sales Analytics Dashboard
A dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze e-commerce sales performance—focusing on revenue trends, profitability, customer behavior, product categories, and payment methods across multiple regions.

2. Short Description / Purpose
The Dhruv Ecommerce Sales Dashboard is an analytical Power BI report created to explore and monitor e-commerce sales data across states, product categories, customers, and payment modes. The dashboard helps business users and analysts quickly identify sales trends, profit drivers, and customer purchasing patterns to support data-driven decision-making.

3. Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Primary platform for dashboard development and visualization
📂 Power Query – Used for data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing
🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Created measures such as total sales, total profit, quantity sold, and average order value
🧩 Data Modeling – Relationships established between Orders and Details tables for accurate aggregation and cross-filtering
📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews

4. Data Source
Source: Publicly shared e-commerce sales dataset (analytics practice dataset)
The dataset consists of structured CSV files representing transactional e-commerce data:
Orders Table – Order date, customer name, state, and payment mode
Details Table – Product category, sub-category, quantity sold, sales amount, and profit
The data is realistic and commonly used for business intelligence and Power BI practice projects.

5. Features / Highlights
• Business Problem
E-commerce businesses generate large volumes of transactional data, but without proper analytics, it becomes difficult to quickly answer key questions such as:
Which states generate the highest sales and profit?
Which product categories and sub-categories are most profitable?
How does profit vary month by month?
Which customers and payment modes contribute the most to sales?
Raw datasets alone do not provide clear, actionable insights.
