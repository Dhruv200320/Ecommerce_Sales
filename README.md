1. Project Title / Headline
🛍️ Dhruv Ecommerce Sales Analytics Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze e-commerce sales performance across regions, categories, customers, and payment modes—providing actionable insights into revenue, profitability, and customer behavior.

2. Short Description / Purpose
The Dhruv Ecommerce Sales Dashboard is a visually rich and analytical Power BI report developed to explore and monitor e-commerce sales data across multiple states, product categories, customers, and payment methods. The dashboard helps stakeholders quickly understand sales trends, profitability patterns, and customer purchasing behavior to support data-driven business decisions.

3. Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Primary platform for building interactive dashboards and visualizations
📂 Power Query – Used for data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing
🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Created calculated measures such as total sales, total profit, quantity sold, and average order value
🧩 Data Modeling – Relationship established between Orders and Details tables to enable cross-filtering and aggregation
📁 File Format – .pbix for dashboard development and .png for visual previews

4. Data Source
Source: Publicly shared e-commerce sales dataset (Google Drive – analytics practice dataset)
The dataset consists of structured CSV files commonly used for Power BI learning and analytics projects:

Orders Table – Contains order-level information such as order ID, date, state, customer name, and payment mode
Details Table – Contains product-level details including category, sub-category, quantity, amount, and profit
The dataset represents realistic transactional e-commerce data and is suitable for business intelligence and visualization use cases.

5. Features / Highlights
• Business Problem
E-commerce businesses generate large volumes of transactional data, but without proper analytics, it becomes difficult to answer key questions such as:

Which states generate the highest sales and profit?
Which product categories and sub-categories are most profitable?
What are customer purchasing patterns?
Which payment modes are most preferred?
How does profit vary month by month?
Raw data alone does not provide quick, actionable insights.

The primary goal of this dashboard is to:

Provide a high-level overview of sales performance
Enable interactive exploration by time period, state, and category
Identify profit-driving and loss-making segments
Support strategic decision-making for marketing, inventory, and operations
